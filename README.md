### Third-party resources used

- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - React components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design.
- [Reach Router](https://github.com/reach/router) - Next Generation Routing for React.

#### Assets and Helpers

- All the colors used in the app can be found in `colors.js` under `assets/js` folder.
- The helper functions for generating mock data and formatting text can be found in `helper_functions.js` under `helpers` folder.
