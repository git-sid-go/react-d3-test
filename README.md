### Quick Start

Get the project running in your local machine with these commands.

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
yarn start
```

### Build and Deployment

Pushing to the `master` branch automatically triggers the build and deploy process in Netlify.

If you want to build the project locally for some reason, run

```bash
yarn build
```

### Project Structure

All of the components used in the app can be found under the `src/components` folder. `App` is the root component.

#### assets

#### mock

The `MockData.js` file under `src/mock` folder contains mock data used in the page stats component.

All of the files under `src/styled_components` folder contains the styles for the various parts of the app.

### Third-party resources used

- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
